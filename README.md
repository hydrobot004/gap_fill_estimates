A 
# [Project 3: Data Science Python, Keras A.I., TensorFlow, and SQL tool to analyze, manipulate, and predict missing data](https://github.com/hydrobot004/gap_fill_estimates)
* Any dataset of three or more time series can be implemented to predict the gaps in one of the datasets
* This project can help you to learn:
**- how to analyze, manipulate, and predict missing data,
**- how to label, plot, and visualize data,
**- how to detect correlations,
**- how to transform or scale data,
**- how to use Keras A.I. libraries for training data and predicting missing observations,
**- python code which can be run on AWS Sagemaker or a desktop Jupyter notebook
